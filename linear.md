1. Work is in the cycle ++ you are assigned: do what Bill Belichick says

2. Work is in the cycle ++ nobody is assigned: feel free to take that work by assigning it to yourself. Our goal is to do all unassigned work that is in the cycle

3. Work is not in the cycle ++ you are assigned: do this work if you want under your 20% time, but do not pull it into the cycle

4. Work is not in the cycle ++ you are not assigned: cmon bro what are you doing

> Gee Justin this sounds dictatorial

yeah. the goal is to be very clear about what we think is the most important thing to work on right this second

> What if I have no work to do in the cycle?

then feel free to bring stuff in, using your best judgment as to what is most important, but be sure to assign it to yourself + give it an estimate
